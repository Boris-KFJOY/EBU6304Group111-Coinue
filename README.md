## Coinue - EBU6304 Software Engineering Project

This project is developed for the EBU6304 Software Engineering module.

Coinue is a financial management application designed to help users track their expenses, manage budgets, and set payment reminders effectively.

## System Requirements

- **Java**: JDK 21 or higher

## Project Architecture

This project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern as required by the software engineering course design:

### üìÅ **Architecture Components**

#### **1. Model (Entity Layer)**

- **Purpose**: Contains all business logic, data models, and data management services
- **Key Classes**:
  - `User.java` - User entity and authentication logic
  - `UserDataService.java` - Data persistence service
  - `UserDataExportService.java` - Data export functionality
  - `UserBillData.java` - Bill payment data model
  - `UserAnalysisData.java` - Financial analysis data model
  - `ExpenseRecord.java` - Expense record entity

#### **2. View (Boundary Layer)**
- **Location**: `src/main/resources/view/`
- **Purpose**: User interface definitions using FXML
- **Key Files**:
  - `MainPage.fxml` - Main dashboard interface
  - `UserPage.fxml` - User management interface
  - `AnalysisPage.fxml` - Financial analysis interface
  - `BillPaymentPage.fxml` - Bill payment interface
  - `Register.fxml` - User registration and login interface

#### **3. Controller (Control Layer)**
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/coinue/controller/`
- **Purpose**: Handles user interactions and coordinates between Model and View
- **Key Classes**:
  - `UserPageController.java` - User management controller
  - `AnalysisPageController.java` - Financial analysis controller
  - `BillPaymentPageController.java` - Bill payment controller
  - `HomepageController.java` - Main dashboard controller

#### **4. Utility Layer**
- **Location**: `src/main/java/com/coinue/util/`
- **Purpose**: Common utilities and helper classes
- **Key Classes**:
  - `PageManager.java` - Navigation management
  - `UserDataManager.java` - User data management utilities

## Dependencies

The project uses the following main dependencies (defined in `pom.xml`):

### **Core Dependencies**
- **JavaFX 21.0.2**: GUI framework
  - `javafx-controls` - UI controls
  - `javafx-fxml` - FXML support
  - `javafx-graphics` - Graphics rendering
  - `javafx-swing` - Swing integration

### **Data Processing**
- **Jackson 2.15.2**: JSON serialization/deserialization
  - `jackson-databind` - Core data binding
  - `jackson-datatype-jsr310` - Java 8 time support
- **Gson 2.10.1**: Alternative JSON processing
- **Apache PDFBox 2.0.27**: PDF generation support

### **Testing Dependencies**
- **JUnit Jupiter 5.10.1**: Unit testing framework
- **TestFX 4.0.17**: JavaFX application testing
- **Mockito 4.8.0**: Mocking framework

## Installation and Execution

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 21 or higher.
    -   You can download it from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/21/).
    -   Verify your installation by running `java -version` in your terminal.
-   **Apache Maven**: Version 3.8.0 or higher.
    -   You can download it from the [Apache Maven Project website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
    -   Verify your installation by running `mvn -version` in your terminal.

### **Setting Up the Project**

There are two ways to get the project files:

**Option 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended for developers)**

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Run the following command to clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Boris-KFJOY/EBU6304Group111-Coinue.git
    ```
3.  This will create a directory named `EBU6304Group111-Coinue`. Navigate into it:
    ```bash
    cd EBU6304Group111-Coinue
    ```

**Option 2: Download and Extract ZIP**

1.  Go to the project's GitHub page: [https://github.com/Boris-KFJOY/EBU6304Group111-Coinue](https://github.com/Boris-KFJOY/EBU6304Group111-Coinue)
2.  Click on the "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP".
3.  Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a directory on your computer.
4.  Navigate into the extracted project folder (e.g., `EBU6304Group111-Coinue-main`).

**After obtaining the project files (using either option above):**

*   **Open with an IDE (Recommended)**:
    *   We recommend using a modern IDE that supports Maven projects, such as:
        *   [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
        *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with Java and Maven extensions.
    *   Open the extracted project folder in your IDE. The IDE should automatically detect it as a Maven project and set it up.

### **Running the Application**

1.  **Navigate to Project Directory**:
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *   Change to the root directory of the extracted project (the one containing `pom.xml`).

2.  **Run the Application**:
    Execute the following Maven command:
    ```bash
    mvn javafx:run -DskipTests
    ```

    *   **Explanation**:
        *   This command compiles the project and starts the JavaFX application.
        *   The `-DskipTests` flag is included to bypass the test execution phase. Running the complete test suite can take approximately one minute.
        *   **Initial Build**: The first time you run this command, Maven will download all necessary dependencies and build the project. This process might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection and system performance. Subsequent runs will be faster.

### **Building the Project (without running)**

If you only want to compile the project, run tests (if not skipped), and package it (e.g., into a JAR file), you can use:

```bash
# Clean, compile, test (unless skipped), and package
mvn install -DskipTests
```
*   This command is useful for building the application for deployment or distribution.
*   The `-DskipTests` flag can be used here as well if you wish to bypass tests during the build.

### **Important Notes**
- The application will automatically log in with a test user (username: "Test", email: "1@q.com", password: "Test1234"). To access the login/signup page, you can navigate to the User Page and click the "Logout" button.
- User data is stored in the `data/users/` directory
- Exported data files are saved in the `data/exports/` directory
